#### `restful-chinook`

Build a RESTful API with CRUD access to all of the musical tables in the `chinook.sqlite` database. Starting with the [restful-chinook](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/restful-chinook), fill in the controller files in `/api` to create a fully-functioning API.

If you have finished the API and are looking for a challenge, write a frontend!  No suggestions from us, impress yourself :)
