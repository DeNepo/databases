## Prep Work

> Before Sunday Class:
> - [Review the Weekly Assignments guide](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments)
> - [Create your Homework Issue](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/homework-submission#homework-issues)

The goal is to make this a very hands-on class. Nonetheless it's important to familiarize yourself with some theoretical concepts surrounding databases before diving in. Dive in [here](./PREPWORK.md).

### Isolate
Check out this week's exercises [here](../isolate/week-1/EXERCISES.md).  You can study them in the [SQLite Tutorial Sandbox](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/tryit/).

### Integrate

You will be learning to use [sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API), a module that allows you to query your SQLite database file.

#### `restful-chinook`

Build a RESTful API with CRUD access to all of the musical tables in the `chinook.sqlite` database. Starting with the [restful-chinook](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/restful-chinook), fill in the controller files in `/api` to create a fully-functioning API.

If you have finished the API and are looking for a challenge, write a frontend!  No suggestions from us, impress yourself :)

#### Deployment

This is a nice first project to try out fullstack deployment.
