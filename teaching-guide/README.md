## Before this Module

In the previous module ([web-apps](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/web-apps), 4 weeks) students learned how to build simple fullstack applications with vanilla JS + express that read and write data from the file system. The final project for Web Apps was an app that reads and writes data from a JSON file and validates all reads/writes against a JSON Schema.

The project for Databases will be the same as the final project for Web Apps, but with SQLite replacing JSON Schema validation and a .json file.

## After this Module

This is it!! The end of the core HYF curriculum. In the last many months students learned how to plan and collaborate on a "three tier" fullstack web application (sort of, the database wasn't hosted separately). The next step for students is to complete a final project where they will build an application from problem to solution beginning with user research, ending with an MVP and pitch. Along the way they will practice with Agile Methodologies and explore new technologies of their choice.

Some students will go directly to the final project after Databases, others will prefer to take some time off or revisit previous modules and come back for a later final project.

Besides the final project, students who have finished the Databases module will be welcome to join any HYF Master Class to learn a new technology or go deeper into a topic covered in the core course. Would you like to help coach a master class, or have an idea for a new master class? Let us know!
